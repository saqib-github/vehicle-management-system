This is an Vehicle Management System with authentication.

On the front-end there is a sign-in & sign-up page.

After sign-up the system will send a welcome email to the user along with a randomly generated password to login on the system later on.

On successful login, there is a simple dashboard showing the number of registered cars.

There is a CRUD for categories e.g. Bus, Sedan, SUV, Hatchback etc.

There is a CRUD for Cars where the user can select one of the categories from the dropdown & can have other fields like color, model, make, registration-no etc.

Used data-tables for sorting & pagination.
